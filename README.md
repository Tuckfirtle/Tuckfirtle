## About
Tuckfirtle is a new original cryptocurrency coin written from scratch in C#. This is an educational project as it is designed to be simple for any developer to follow and learn together.
The aim of this project is to equip new entry level developers into cryptocurrency and make an original coin together. As a result, we also build a healthy relationship with the community around us.
The reason not to fork an existing coin and use their code as base is due to complexity and the dependencies needed to build a coin is extremely ridiculous. Forking existing coin tend to not do well in long run and thus the reason to write from scratch.

This coin will aim to be fully decentralized with variable blocktime and supply to create incentive to mine. Transaction may not be instant but it can happen in less than a minute to 5 minutes long with variable blocktime.
The POW algorithm is brand new and it is being tested for suitability for asic resistance.
More information about this coin will be written when we have iron out the idea.

## Basic Information
- Coin Name: Tuckfirtle (TF)
- Github: https://github.com/Tuckfirtle/Tuckfirtle
- Discord: http://discord.gg/eEXTB3T
- Blockchain Mining Type: Proof of work (POW)
- POW Mining Algorithm: [TuckfirtlePow](https://github.com/Tuckfirtle/Tuckfirtle.Core/blob/master/src/Pow/TuckfirtlePow.cs)
- Target Block time: 1 Minute
- Target Block reward: 1 TF
- Total Supply: TBD
- Premine: 0%
- CPU/ARM Minable: Yes
- GPU/FPGA Minable: Possible but it may not be as efficient as CPU with the memory hard loop. (This is not proven to be true as of now.)
- ASIC Minable: Could be possible but the efficiency should not be as fast as CPU with the memory hard loop. (This is not proven to be true as of now.)
- Pool Mining: Yes

Note: The actual block time is variable depedning on mining speed. The block reward will be capped to 1 TF per minute. If the block happen to found too early, the reward will scale down to balance up the total supply created.
