# Contributing to Tuckfirtle
Thank you for joining and interesting in contributing to Tuckfirtle project!

We have a set of contributing guildlines on how the code is written and what are the typical convention to take note of when writting codes.

# Coding Conventions
This project utilize resharper to format the code. I have included the resharper settings in each submodule in case you need them.
Most of the coding convention have been defined in resharper and here are some that you will normally see in our code base.

- Prefer var vs explicit types for local variable.

All the codes had preference for var than writing explicitly of the type it should be used. It will be an exception to follow this if explicit type is required.

- Pascal naming convention for classes, methods, functions, properties and more.
- Camel naming convention for arguments, variable and more.
- Interface should be prefix with "I" and with Pascal naming convention.
